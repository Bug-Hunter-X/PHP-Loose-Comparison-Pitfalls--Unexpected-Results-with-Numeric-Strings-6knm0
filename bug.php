This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  When comparing a string with a number, PHP will attempt to convert the string to a number for the comparison. This can lead to unexpected results.

```php
<?php
$string = "10abc";
$number = 10;

if ($string == $number) {
  echo "Strings are equal!";
}
?>
```

In this example, `$string` is "10abc", and `$number` is 10. Because the `==` operator performs loose comparison, PHP converts the string "10abc" to a number during the comparison.  It takes the leading numeric part, resulting in the number 10. The comparison then becomes `10 == 10`, which evaluates to `true`, leading to the output "Strings are equal!".  This is probably not the intended behavior.
